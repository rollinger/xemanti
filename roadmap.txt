STEPS:
1. Basic Functionalities (DE_Engine)
OK 1G, 2G, 3G, Sentences
OK Associations (1Gto1G, 2Gto1G, 3Gto1G)
OK Rating Associations(Sentences)
OK Rating None possible (Skip Rating)
OK standardize input (lowercase, strip punctuation,...)
OK improve tokenization
OK rate target occures only once not as much as combinations exits (overweight)
OK rating performance improvements
OK rating as a background job (django-celery)
OK tokenization strip punctuation in words
OK inbound and outbound associations
OK Virtual Attributes (Discriminatory Power, Relative Connectivity, Devianz)
OK stats calculation as a cronjob (dirty bool attribute)
NO flag/delete as a cronjob (django-crontab)
OK cascading delete (NGram => all Associations where source == NGram)
OK Admin Interface
OK Custom Actions in Admin (Delete_by_Occurrence)
OK Set dirty = true if ngram was injected
OK Enable Rating OneGram (TwoGram, ThreeGram) (added regularily to Sentence queue via maintenance)
OK Authentication 
OK Register
OK Login
OK Logout
OK User Profile, Xemanti-Balance
OK Nonsense Rating in model
OK Probe Association (develop core functionality for the Reporting interface)
OK Create Profile on user registration (with 100 xemanti)
OK Stop adding Sentences that are highly rated nonsense
O Import Wiktionary Dump 250000 ngrams
-- Cleanup (delete strange languages, etc...)
- NGramEngine workflow optimization
:: new_text is split and each ngram is added to the system and all meaningful coooccurrences are added. 
:: meaningful cooccurrence: ngram pairs that do not belong to a (semantically) meaningless part of speech (e.g. articles,pronouns,...) and are in the language of the language of the system (Deutsch) are considered a meaningful cooccurrence - thus added to the system. This table get laaaaarge!
